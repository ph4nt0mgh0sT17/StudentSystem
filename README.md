# StudentSystem
This is only training project to get to know with most basic things in C# + communication with database via EntityFrameworkCore...

## Aim
Aim is to create student system that handles all kind of operations you would expect from the student system.
You can register students to some courses, you can pass some marks to their assignments, you can remove the students, etc. etc...

## Setup environment
If you want to test/try the application or add some features feel free to do so but you need at first to setup your environment so the application can communicate with database etc.

All you need to do is you have to install the MySQL server on your workstation (MySQL 8.0).

Then you need to run SQL scripts that will initiate the database and fill the tables with some data.
This script is found in the folder DB_Scripts.
